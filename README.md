[Presentation: Inception and Easy Transfer Learning](2017-09-28/transfer_learning.pdf) | [Code: dvisockas/retrain](https://github.com/dvisockas/retrain)



Presenter: Danielius Visockas

About: Using to state-of-the art computer vision models (Inception and Easy Transfer Learning) for your own projects. There have been some huge recent advancements in the field of computer vision, but one of the biggest of them is the availability of the state-of-the-art models because of the ImageNet competition.

## Meetup #7 (2018-03-15)

[Presentation: Online Machine Learning](https://slides.com/dariusaliulis/online-ml)

Presenter: Darius Aliulis

Online Machine Learning deals with machine learning model updates.
When new data arrives training new model every time is inefficient: online learning solves that.
In this presentation we will cover Scikit-Learn models that allow PARTIAL FITTING.
We will also be introduced to Vowpal Wabbit, a production-grade machine learning library for online learning.

## [Meetup #8 (2018-04-05)](2018-04-05/)

[Presentation: Analysis of Lithuanian texts: a case of moon and femininity](2018-04-05/)

Presenter: Evaldas Vaičiukynas

Abstract: Presentation will discuss machine learning task of text classification. Text corpora was ASTRA stenograms, containing 110905 Lithuanian parliamentary transcripts from 147 speakers, collected during 1990 March - 2013 December. Texts were categorized by the political partisanship of a speaker, the gender of a speaker and the fact that a transcript was recorded around a full moon date. Types of pre-processing considered: original text, lemmized, morphized and translated to English. Lemmas and morphemes were obtained using semantika.lt and English translation using Google Translate services. Feature sets investigated: 6 from gensim (3 Doc2Vec variants, LSI, LDA, RP), 1 from fastText (Sent2Vec), and 3 custom-made (morfologija, stilometNER, ontologija). Random forest was used as a base-learner as well as a meta-learner (in 7 "stacking" configurations). Experiments reveal which categories, which types of pre-processing and which feature sets appear to be the most successful for texts analysed.
